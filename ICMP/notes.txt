Echo Request/Reply (Type 8/0): Used to test connectivity and measure network latency. An Echo Request message is sent to a destination, and 
                               if the destination is reachable, it responds with an Echo Reply message.
Destination Unreachable (Type 3): Informs the sender that the destination is unreachable due to various reasons, such as network congestion,
                                  invalid IP address, or firewall blocking.
Time Exceeded (Type 11): Indicates that the maximum number of hops allowed for a packet has been reached without reaching the destination.
Parameter Problem (Type 12): Notifies the sender that an error occurred while processing the IP header, such as an invalid IP option or an
                             incorrect IP header length.
Router Advertisement (Type 9): Sent by routers to advertise their presence and provide routing information to hosts.
Router Solicitation (Type 10): Sent by hosts to solicit router advertisements from nearby routers.
Timestamp Request/Reply (Type 13/14): Used to measure the round-trip time between two hosts for synchronization purposes.

========================================= FOR ICMP ECHO REQUEST ==============================================
most firewall by default block the ICMP's id field of 0. Change it to something other than 0.======= best to generate it randomly
