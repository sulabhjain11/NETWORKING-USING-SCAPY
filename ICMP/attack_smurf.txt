DDOS ATTACK.
The attacker first gets the ip address of the target. 
The attacker than sends an ICMP PACKET, either to the local broadcast or the directed broadcast to that network, spoofed as the target's ip.
If broadcasting is available on the network, all the other devices in the network will ping flood the target.
NOTE: 1 ICMP-REQUEST IS SENT BY THE TARGET, CORRESPONDING TO WHICH ALL THE DEVICES IN THE NETWORK, INCLUDING ALL THE DEVICES IN THE SUBNETS SEND AN ICMP- REPLE TO THE TARGET.
