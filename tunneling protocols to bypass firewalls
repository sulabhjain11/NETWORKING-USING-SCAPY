ICMP Tunneling: ICMP tunneling encapsulates data within ICMP packets, which are often allowed through firewalls
                that block other protocols like TCP or UDP. By encapsulating data within ICMP packets, users can bypass these
                restrictions and establish communication channels that would otherwise be blocked.

GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation): GRE is a versatile tunneling protocol that can encapsulate various protocols,
               including IP, within GRE packets. GRE packets can be transmitted over various networks, including
               Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI.

IPsec (IP Security): IPsec is a secure encapsulation protocol that provides authentication, encryption, and integrity
               protection for IP packets. IPsec tunnels can be used to bypass firewalls by encapsulating data within
               IPsec packets, which can be transmitted securely over public networks.

SSH (Secure Shell): SSH is a secure remote access protocol that can also be used for tunneling. By establishing an
               SSH tunnel, users can encapsulate data within SSH packets, allowing them to bypass firewalls and establish
               connections to blocked resources.

SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security): SSL/TLS are secure communication protocols that can be used
               for tunneling. Similar to SSH, SSL/TLS tunnels encapsulate data within SSL/TLS packets, allowing users
               to bypass firewalls and establish secure connections.

PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol): PPTP is an older tunneling protocol that encapsulates data within GRE packets
               and adds additional authentication and encryption layers. While less commonly used today, PPTP was once a
               popular method for establishing VPNs.

L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol): L2TP is another tunneling protocol that encapsulates data within PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
               packets and provides additional control and signaling features. L2TP is often used in conjunction with IPSec for
               secure VPN connections.

VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN): VXLAN is a relatively new tunneling protocol that encapsulates Ethernet frames within UDP packets.
               VXLAN is particularly useful for creating virtual networks within data centers or cloud environments.

Obfuscation Methods: Attackers may also employ obfuscation techniques to make their tunneling attempts less detectable
               by firewalls. These methods may involve fragmenting packets, using custom protocols, or hiding tunneling
               within other protocols like DNS or HTTP.
