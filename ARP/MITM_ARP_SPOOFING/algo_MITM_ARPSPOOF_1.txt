# TARGETING TWO DEVICES

turn on ip_forwarding in the attacker device(here kali)
get the ip address and the mac address of the two victim devices either using:
        arp -a (arp caching)
        passive arp sniffing
        active arp sniffing
perform MITM: by sending the one packet to each victim

MAINTAINING OF MITM:
     actively listen on the network for any arp-request from either of the two victim devices. If you sniff any, send the arp spoofed packet
     to that device that has requested the arp-request from the second victim device.
     
     continue listening

REMOVING TRACES FROM THE TARGET DEVICES.
     When the attacker presses control-c, its time to quit.
     before quitting, send original arp-response to the two victims to update their arp table.
     
TAKEAWAY OF THIS METHOD AND THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE.
most decices update their arp table only with those arp-responses that it has arp-requested for.
     IMPROVEMENT: listen on the network. sniff the arp-requested packet, and than send a response with the crafted packet beginning from the
                  initial stage before performing MITM.
                  Also, if u send a crafted response to the target, and the target1's response reaches target1 after that, than it may
                  fail.Therefore, send your packet multiple times.
