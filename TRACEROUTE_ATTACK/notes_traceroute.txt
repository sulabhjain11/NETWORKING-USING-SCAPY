================= PROTOCOLS THAT CAN BE USED FOR TRACEROUTE =========================

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): ICMP is the most commonly used protocol for traceroute, as it is widely supported
            and often permitted through firewalls. It utilizes ICMP echo requests (pings) to elicit responses from intermediate
            routers along the path, providing information about each hop.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): UDP is another commonly used protocol for traceroute. It sends UDP packets to various destination
            ports on each router, with the expectation that the router will discard them and generate ICMP echo replies.
            This method can be more effective in environments where ICMP echo requests are blocked.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP can also be used for traceroute, but it is less common due to its overhead and potential
            connection establishment issues. TCP traceroute sends SYN (synchronize) packets to each router,
            and the SYN-ACK (synchronize acknowledgment) replies provide information about the route.

SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol): SCTP is a newer protocol that can be used for traceroute. It sends SCTP INIT
            packets to each router, and the SCTP INIT-ACK packets provide information about the route. SCTP traceroute is
            less common than ICMP, UDP, or TCP traceroute.

Raw IP: Raw IP traceroute sends raw IP packets without any encapsulation within other protocols. This method is less common
            due to its potential security implications.

Traceroute over IPv6: Traceroute can also be performed over IPv6 networks using ICMPv6 echo requests or other protocols.
